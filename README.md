**Abstract:**

> We measure the causal impact of reductions in benchmark interest rates on the renegotiation and performance of distressed loans, using 2000s subprime mortgages as a laboratory. Subprime borrowers treated with larger benchmark rate reductions benefited from increased debt-renegotiation probabilities and lower debt-service payments. Modification rates were similar among current and delinquent borrowers but higher for real estate investors, highlighting the role of financial acumen in renegotiation. Renegotiations also reduced longer-run foreclosures, but these benefits were offset by treated borrowers who lingered in delinquency. Findings indicate that monetary easing can spur debt-renegotiation but alone may not lead to longer-run curative outcomes.


**Code Instructions:**

*  `_RunAll_.R` to generate the tables and figures in the paper 
* The figures and tables will be in the `output-plots` and `output-tex` folders
* The data files in the `data` folder have zero records in accordance with vendor's data sharing agreement, but the files do show the variable names and the class of each column can be viewed with `sapply(DT, class)`.
